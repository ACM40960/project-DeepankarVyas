The Brazilian might get the nod again after a solid performance against Stuttgart last week.Joselu and Eren Derdiyok compete for the spot up front.Shocking news reports appeared on Friday that Boris Vukcevic is in a life-threatening condition after a car accident.Augsburg's team news states that Sebastian Langkamp is injured and could be replaced by Ragnar Klavan at centre-back.Milan Petrzela will most likely replace the injured Knowledge Musona on the right wing again, although manager Weinzierl has pointed out that he has several other options in this position.Torsten Oehrl could start in central attacking midfield with Jan Moravek dropping to the bench and Aristide Bancé playing up front.

After three losses in their first three games, Hoffenheim have finally found their form and managed to win their last two games, scoring six in the process. Manager Babbel's job seems to be safe for now.Augsburg are last in the table with only one point from five games so far. They have only scored two times and need to avoid defensive mistakes and work on attacking patterns now to regain confidence. Expect Hoffenheim to dominate the game at home. They should be clear favourites against a disappointing Augsburg team so far.","Sat",0.748713863243781,-1.54642106760683,-0.391589556538645,-0.353304943593524,1.22054942269385,-0.664309430024881,0.188669240365447,-0.952150499263831,-0.208452652169339,-1.77822878073827,0.66163485872361,-1.67695218920569,-0.103245095650976,-0.499846125745184,"DRAW"

Fürth have only won once this season. They have not won a point or scored at home so far and need to improve in all areas if they are to have any chance.Hamburg have been in fine form lately, having won seven points from three games against Dortmund, Gladbach and Hannover. They need to improve their performances in the second half though as they have been under pressure late on in every match.Expect Hamburg to try to dominate a hard-fought game from the start.

Hannover have had a decent start to the season, but two defeats in their last three games have had an effect on the team's confidence. It remains to be seen how quickly they recover from another Europa League week.Dortmund did not have a great start to the campaign, but they are third in the table and should be full of confidence after a strong performance at Manchester City in the Champions League during the week.Expect Dortmund to dominate the game from the outset.

Some players might be tired after a Europa League game during the week though.Expect this to be an open game with Leverkusen the more organised team.","Sun",-0.951105714273495,0.957318877788127,0.45993890795537,0.463270426807523,-0.458258641164546,1.65845081481737,-0.980107774741936,1.43605017469444,-1.09978383305305,1.18173656438835,-0.740213110208832,1.26126755140307,-0.65164326660163,0.237788965619641,"HOME_WIN"

Nürnberg have not been in the strong form they left off from last season so far and need to improve on the attack again.

They are heavy favourites at home.","Tue",0.748713863243781,-0.1554544312763,0.318017497206368,-1.16988031399457,0.660946734741052,-1.34747420791966,1.2592457022822,-0.469094276784334,1.87132010322599,-0.890239177200284,1.97002629639389,-0.299661685795334,0.871684986039075,-0.315437352903978,"DRAW"

Hannover have lost their last two games and need a result at home now to regain their spot in the top six. Some players could be a bit tired after many games in the last two weeks.Fürth performed well in a draw against Nürnberg last weekend, but only eight points from thirteen matches so far is simply not enough if they are to stand any chance of staying up this season.

Düsseldorf have done well in the last few days, with four points from two matches against Hamburg and Dortmund.

Expect Stuttgart to try to dominate the game from the outset and Fürth to wait for their chances on the counter.","Sat",-0.951105714273495,-0.433647758542406,-0.10774673504064,-0.897688523860888,-0.877960657129145,-0.254410563288012,-0.729161050941173,0.0395323510098081,-1.39689422668096,-0.00224957366229594,-1.39440882904397,0.343073882462833,-0.895375787024143,-0.499846125745184,"AWAY_WIN"

Between them, the teams only have eight points, one win and a goal difference of -17.","Sat",-1.80101550303213,-0.711841085808513,0.0341746757083625,-0.625496733727206,-1.57746401707014,-0.800942385603837,-1.02623855797993,-0.874766407700412,-1.69400462030886,-1.48223224622561,-1.67477842283046,-1.40149408852362,-1.0172420472354,-1.0530724442688,"DRAW"

Leverkusen are second in the Bundesliga and they can keep that spot until January with a draw against Hamburg. It remains to be seen how the team will deal with several injuries and suspensions, though.Hamburg have gone three games without a loss and could jump into the top six with a win against Leverkusen. The players will be highly motivated to head into the winter break with another positive result.Expect this to be an open game with several chances for both sides. Leverkusen should be slight favourites at home.","Sat",1.03201712616333,-0.1554544312763,-0.959275199534655,0.0549827416069996,0.660946734741052,-0.391043518866969,1.23583711084235,-0.0918250757836376,1.57420970959809,0.885740029875692,0.9420044525101,0.893990083826973,0.506086205405305,-0.00808939816863425,"HOME_WIN"

Bremen have not found any consistency so far, as their recent 1-4 loss at Frankfurt proved.

Expect Bremen to dominate possession and Nürnberg to try to hit them on the break.","Sun",0.465410600324235,-0.1554544312763,1.59531019394739,-1.44207210412825,0.241244718776453,-1.21084125234071,-0.63598487309434,0.06995677162856,0.0886577414585668,0.293746960850364,-0.272930453898018,0.526712616250878,-0.0423119655453482,-0.315437352903978,"DRAW"

Bremen had a difficult first half of the season.

Both teams need a win in order to keep their chance to challenge Bayern for the title alive.","Sun",0.465410600324235,1.79189885958645,0.45993890795537,-0.217209048526683,0.381145390764653,2.47824854829111,1.47980676577849,1.02057292775065,0.979988922342279,0.885740029875692,0.848547921247934,1.44490628519111,0.810751855933446,1.40571119361395,"AWAY_WIN"

Frankfurt have won their last two games in a very effective way. The team is hard to beat at the moment and keeps hold of fourth place for now.Nürnberg won their first game under new manager Wiesinger last weekend and improved in several departments in order to do so.

It remains to be seen if they can turn things around ahead of their Champions League week to regain some kind of form.Expect this to be a hard-fought game, with Mainz pressing high up the pitch to force early errors.","Sat",-0.101195925514857,-0.1554544312763,-1.24311802103266,1.27984579720857,0.101344046788253,-0.527676474445925,-0.253002522009041,-0.903349928084545,0.385768135086468,-0.890239177200284,-0.0860173913736938,-1.12603598784155,0.201420554877165,-0.131028580062772,"DRAW"

Freiburg have won their last two games and, after an impressive result at Bremen last weekend, are in good stead to defend their spot in the top five for now.

It will be interesting to see how the team will do without a natural striker on the pitch.Expect Dortmund to dominate the game from the start.","Sun",-0.384499188434403,2.07009218685255,-0.249668145789642,-0.489400838660365,-0.877960657129145,1.79508377039633,-0.306541430945504,1.30283857015123,-0.505563045797245,1.47773309890102,-0.833669641470998,1.07762881761502,-0.164178225756605,1.46718078456102,"DRAW"

Bayern certainly want to win against manager Heynckes former club, who beat them in the reverse fixture earlier in the season.","Sat",-0.101195925514857,2.34828551411866,1.73723160469639,1.96032527254278,2.05995345462305,1.52181785923842,-0.159193384093324,3.28603075146032,0.385768135086468,2.365722702439,0.194352202412796,2.1794612203433,0.810751855933446,3.49567728581429,"AWAY_WIN"

Gladbach lost at Freiburg last weekend, after four games without a defeat.

The team looks more fit and focussed again since going out of the Europa League.Expect this to be a close game, with both teams fighting hard to create chances.","Sun",-0.951105714273495,-0.990034413074619,-0.391589556538645,-0.0811131534598417,0.241244718776453,-0.664309430024881,-0.534615230275436,0.0464867092012846,-0.802673439425146,0.885740029875692,-0.553300047684508,0.710351350038924,-1.0172420472354,-0.131028580062772,"HOME_WIN"

Hoffenheim need to recover from a 2-1 defeat at Hamburg last weekend in order to defend third spot ahead of Dortmund.

Leipzig are full of confidence after back-to-back 3-2 wins at Dortmund and against Porto.

Bayern are back on track in all competitions after manager Jupp Heynckes' return to the club, but struggled in the 1-1 cup draw with Leipzig on Wednesday night, before they progressed to the next round on penalties. They need to improve in possession again and become more versatile in their passing.Leipzig were level with Bayern in the DFB-Pokal encounter, but a second yellow card for central midfielder Naby Keita possibly cost them the chance to overcome the Bavarians. Away from home they will now face a more difficult task, but with rested players like Diego Demme and Timo Werner returning, they might have the tools to trouble the defending champions again.Expect Leipzig to put in another brave and high-pressing display, but Bayern to be favourites to edge an exciting encounter.","Sat",1.59862365200242,0.122738895989807,2.0210744261944,-1.16988031399457,0.940748078717452,0.428754214606768,1.14531527035767,1.74541932549507,1.27709931597018,1.47773309890102,1.40928710882091,1.90400311966123,0.932618116144703,0.360728147513778,"HOME_WIN"

Dortmund are winless in their last five matches in the Bundesliga and Champions League and lost back-to-back competitive home games before the disappointing 1-1 draw with APOEL. With the Signal-Iduna-Park having lost its status as a fortress for now and BVB's 4-2 defeat at Hannover from last weekend in mind, the side desperately needs to improve its balance again to have a chance against the resurrected defending champions.Bayern have won all of their six competitive matches, in regular time or after penalties, since manager Jupp Heynckes returned to the club and were able to rest key players in the Champions League this week.

Wolfsburg manager Martin Schmidt is yet to win his first game in charge of the club after putting together seven draws in a row. A second home game in a row might provide him the chance to break his duck. Freiburg have only picked up a single point from their last four matches and now sit in the relegation play-off spot.

RB Leipzig have only won one of their last five Bundesliga matches and given up second spot to Schalke as a result.

Bayer Leverkusen headed into the winter break in a strong fourth spot after finally finding more stability this season. They are unbeaten in 12 Bundesliga matches and have not lost at home this season, while boasting the league's third-best attack overall.Bayern found stability after former manger Jupp Heynckes returned to the club and replacement Carlo Ancelotti in October.

Bremen desperately need results in the second half of the season to improve their situation in the relegation battle. They boasted a strong defence in the first half of the campaign, but scored the second-fewest goals, which needs to change for them to climb up the table.Hoffenheim enjoyed a solid first half of the season, considering their injury concerns and the fact they were playing in Europe for the first time. They lost their Champions League play-offs against Liverpool, though, and crashed out of the Europa League at the group stages, meaning they can fully focus on their domestic campaign now, where they are looking for another European finish.Expect this to be a close and intense game, in which Bremen will try to take advantage of the visitors' injury concerns in central mdfield.","Sat",-0.667802451353949,-0.433647758542406,0.0341746757083625,-1.57816799919509,-0.178457297188146,-0.117777607709057,-0.502315562924547,-0.501419249181834,0.0886577414585668,-0.29824610817496,0.00743913988846811,-0.299661685795334,-0.407910746179117,0.29925855656671,"DRAW"

Gladbach have to get back on track quickly, if they want to retain a chance of qualifying for Europe again.

Borussia Dortmund are still unbeaten in the Bundesliga since manager Peter Stöger took over in December, but they keep struggling in possession and are relying on individual quality way too much.

Hamburg performed well in a 1-1 draw at in-form Stuttgart last weekend as new manager Christian Titz continued to integrate younger players into the starting XI. His possession-based approach gave the side more confidence on the ball, but it remains to be seen if they are able to create chances against Schalke's well-organised defence here.Schalke have won six straight Bundesliga matches, only conceding a single goal in this run. They have found an impressive way to edge close matches and will hope to take another step towards securing second spot and their Champions League return here.Expect an improved Hamburg side trying to look for their chances and building up from the back again, with Schalke too much for them in current form.","Sat",-1.51771224011259,-0.1554544312763,-0.249668145789642,-1.30597620906141,-1.01786132911734,-0.391043518866969,-0.370258097670472,1.21133006097799,-1.39689422668096,2.365722702439,-1.20749576651965,2.1794612203433,-1.4437739579748,0.79101528414326,"HOME_WIN"

Hertha need to get back on track after a 2-1 defeat at Gladbach last weekend.

Both will be assessed nearer the game according to coach Lucien Favre.Götze suffered a hairline fracture in his forearm and a ligament strain in his wrist during the Ruhr derby but was fit enough to appear as a sub in midweek.Former captain Marcel Schmelzer is ruled out with a hip injury, but Lukasz Piszczek could return to the defence, along with Germany left-back Nico Schulz.Paco Alcácer made the bench in midweek after recovering from an Achilles injury and could make a return to the starting line up.Wolfsburg's team news states that Coach Oliver Glasner will have to see how his side react to the 6-1 cup thrashing at home in midweek. Rotation will probably be the order of the day, injuries permitting.USMNT international John Brooks is chomping at the bit for a return and could replace the inconsistent Jeffrey Bruma in defence.Josuha Guilavogui will bolster midfield after sitting out in midweek through suspension.

This Borussia Dortmund side showed good spirit to rally past Gladbach in the cup in midweek but have been missing the goal threat of the injured Paco Alcácer in recent weeks. Buoyed by that late comeback, and if the former Barca striker is finally fit, BVB can win this against a Wolfsburg side that could be set for a downward spiral if the midweek result is any indication.","Sat",-0.101195925514857,-0.990034413074619,2.3049172476924,-0.897688523860888,0.660946734741052,-0.527676474445925,0.79313455094089,0.115302461987819,0.0886577414585668,0.589743495363028,0.287808733674958,0.343073882462833,0.567019335510934,0.360728147513778,"HOME_WIN"

But the ex-Spurs midfielder will keep himself fit with the U23 side before being sold in the winter break.

This game is intriguingly poised.Leverkusen can beat anybody on their day as seen in Munich last weekend. However, such is their unpredictability they can regularly flatter to deceive as well.

Pentke made his Bundesliga debut last weekend at the age of 34.Robert Skov missed last week's defeat and remains doubtful with a muscle injury. Steven Zuber is nearing a return to the squad, but Ishak Belfodil has undergone a knee operation and is unlikely to play again this season according to coach Alfred Schreuder.

Bremen kept their first clean sheet of the season last weekend, a good sign for the side with the worst defensive record in the league.However, Bremen paid a high price, losing debutant Kevin Vogt to concussion, while captain Niklas Moisander was sent off in the frantic final minutes.Potentially those two key absences could scupper Bremen's hopes of following up with a home win against an average Hoffenheim outfit.","Sun",-1.51771224011259,0.122738895989807,1.45338878319839,0.191078636673841,-1.15776200110554,-0.391043518866969,-0.855810329565303,-0.102790311093355,-1.09978383305305,-0.29824610817496,-0.459843516422346,-0.0242035851132617,-1.0172420472354,-0.253967761956909,"AWAY_WIN"

In their previous 71 games, Bayern have failed to score on only two occasions, both against Leipzig who they played last week.Bayern have notably been trailing in their last four games but have fought back to earn eight points.Union's eight-game unbeaten run came to an end in the Berlin derby and are unlikely to start another streak here.","Sat",1.88192691492196,1.23551220505423,-0.391589556538645,-0.0811131534598417,0.241244718776453,0.565387170185724,-0.111748790927692,1.34794523014722,0.979988922342279,1.18173656438835,0.194352202412796,0.710351350038924,0.506086205405305,1.0983632388786,"DRAW"

Schalke conceded an equaliser in added time at the weekend to stretch their winless run to 27 games, the second worst run ever in the history of the Bundesliga. The Royal Blues continue to close in on Tasmania Berlin who went 31 games without a win in 1965/66 for an unenviable record.Schalke have conceded at least one goal in their previous 23 games, so a clean sheet is hard to imagine. Freiburg picked up their first win since the opening matchday at the weekend and can carry on the good work against a potentially demoralized Schalke.","Wed",-0.667802451353949,-0.433647758542406,0.0341746757083625,-0.0811131534598417,-0.598159313152746,0.565387170185724,-0.995000439654152,-0.490957960452407,-1.39689422668096,-0.594242642687625,-1.30095229778181,0.0676157817807608,-1.50470708808042,-0.499846125745184,"AWAY_WIN"

Wolfsburg have shared the spoils on six occasions already this term, and a draw could be the answer here.","Sun",1.31532038908287,1.51370553232034,0.45993890795537,-1.16988031399457,1.64025143865845,1.65845081481737,0.467319637201278,0.241134159451244,0.979988922342279,0.293746960850364,0.38126526493712,0.526712616250878,0.384219945194049,0.422197738460847,"HOME_WIN"

Havard Nordtveit has a thigh injury, while star forward Andrej Kramaric is proving as reliable as ever after recovering from his encounter with COVID-19.

Schalke are winless in 30 games, the second worst run ever in the history of the Bundesliga. The unthinkable awaits as the Royal Blues edge inexorably towards Tasmania Berlin who went 31 games without a win in 1965/66 for an unenviable record.Schalke have conceded at least one goal in their previous 26 games, while Hoffenheim have not kept a clean sheet all season (14 games), so a clean sheet is hard to imagine. Hoffenheim have been imperious in Europa League action, but domestic form has generally left a lot to be desired. Hoffenheim should have the quality to win this, but all runs have to end somewhere, even for sorry Schalke.","Sat",-1.51771224011259,-0.1554544312763,-1.52696084253066,0.0549827416069996,-0.598159313152746,0.155488303448856,-1.18604835550232,-0.757081856470106,-1.69400462030886,-0.29824610817496,-1.67477842283046,-0.575119786477406,-1.87030586871419,-0.253967761956909,"HOME_WIN"

Leverkusen won the race for talented Leicester winger Demarai Gray and he will hope to make the matchday squad here.Leverkusen's third January arrival, Jeremie Frimpong, is free to play after emerging from quarantine. Julian Baumgartlinger has had a knee operation but hopes to play again this season.

Only Bayern Munich (22) have collected more points than Stuttgart (17) in away matches in the Bundesliga this season, though they have lost three of their last four on the road. Bayer Leverkusen have only won one of their last seven league games and are now completely out of the title picture as injuries take their toll. With an extra day to rest and prepare for this game, Leverkusen will look to take advantage of Stuttgart's downturn in form on the road but will have to be mindful of an in-form Silas Wamangituka.","Sat",-1.23440897719304,0.400932223255914,0.0341746757083625,0.599366321874364,0.660946734741052,1.52181785923842,-0.662855722872497,-0.201636034471058,-0.802673439425146,-0.00224957366229594,-0.92712617273316,-0.116022952007289,0.810751855933446,0.360728147513778,"HOME_WIN"

The ex-Spurs manager is Schalke's fourth coach since September. Schalke loaned Ozan Kabak to Liverpool on deadline day and promptly replaced him with Arsenal's Shkodran Mustafi, their second January arrival from the Gunners following Sead Kolasinac's return.William has joined from Wolfsburg on loan until the end of the season and will probably slot straight into the side.Veteran striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar is back from Ajax and the former Real Madrid striker could be on the bench after shaking off a calf problem. Skipper Omar Mascarell is battling a calf injury, while defender Salif Sane has a knee problem. Steven Skrzybski has a torn muscle.Goalkeeper Frederik Rönnow is fit after a muscle injury, but Ralf Fährmann will retain his spot.Kilian Ludewig needs a foot operation and will be out for a minimum of 10 weeks.After a squabble, Vedad Ibisevic's contract has been paid up, while Nabil Bentaleb will train individually until further notice. Amine Harit was, however, given a reprieve.Gonçalo Paciencia is still on the mend from a knee operation.RBL's team news states that January signing Dominik Szoboszlai has adductor problems and has still not played his first game for the club.Emil Forsberg has a knee injury and is ruled out.Kevin Kampl and skipper Marcel Sabitzer have minor injury worries and will be assessed nearer kick-off.Christopher Nkunku, Justin Kluivert and Nordi Mukiele could all return here.Hee-Chan Hwang is back in training after his encounter with COVID-19, as is Lazar Samardzic.Marcel Halstenberg is over his adductor problems, but fellow German international Benjamin Henrichs is ruled out with a knee injury.Konrad Laimer and Lukas Klostermann also have knee issues, with the latter the nearest to a return.

This is another crunch game for Schalke who last month at least avoided matching Tasmania Berlin who went 31 games without a win in 1965/66.But after smashing Hoffenheim 4-0 to avoid an unwanted record, the bottom club have scrambled just a point in four subsequent games, leaving the Royal Blues nine points from safety.RB Leipzig remain Bayern's nearest challengers but are seven points adrift.Draws are no good for either side but Schalke, in their current predicament, could nick a point here. This could shape up to be another top weekend for Bayern.","Sat",-0.101195925514857,-0.1554544312763,-1.10119661028366,0.599366321874364,-0.598159313152746,0.155488303448856,-0.943039176780391,0.622792855984489,-0.802673439425146,-0.00224957366229594,-1.11403923525748,0.434893249356855,-2.05310525903108,0.913954466037397,"AWAY_WIN"

Four points behind Bayern, RB Leipzig have kept the title race interesting in Germany for seemingly the first time in eight years. 12 clean sheets from reliable goalkeeper Péter Gulácsi are a joint-league best.Lowly Arminia Bielefeld shocked Bayer Leverkusen last Sunday and took a deserved point off Bayern in their own backyard recently as well, moving out of the relegation spots.Bielefeld are not to be underestimated, but Leipzig must win to stay in title contention and should take the three points.","Fri",-1.51771224011259,1.23551220505423,-0.249668145789642,-1.16988031399457,-0.598159313152746,2.2049826371332,-0.410697367633234,1.39256271838596,-0.802673439425146,1.77372963341368,-0.179473922635856,1.26126755140307,-1.50470708808042,1.59011996645515,"AWAY_WIN"

The Belgian international has not played this year, but at least fellow defenders Jordan Torunarigha and Marvin Plattenhardt are nearing a return, along with Jessic Ngankam and Javairo Dilrosun.Luca Netz made his debut as a substitute recently. At 17 years and 232 days, the left-sided defender is the second youngest ever player in the club's history.Leverkusen's team news states that Leverkusen desperately miss Lukás Hrádecky in goal, having suffered an Achilles injury. Niklas Lomb struggled as a replacement, so Lennart Grill is the new man between the sticks.Moussa Diaby and Jamaica international Leon Bailey are both available, so ex-Leicester man Demarai Gray could drop to the bench.Another January arrival Timothy Fosu-Mensah has suffered an ACL injury and will be out for several months. Daley Sinkgraven is out for three weeks with a thigh injury and will be replaced at left-back by Wendell. Leverkusen's third January arrival, Jeremie Frimpong, is also a good option and could feature on the right side of defence.Julian Baumgartlinger has had a knee operation but hopes to play again this season. Nadiem Amiri is back in the squad after his bout of COVID-19, joining Wendell, Daley Sinkgraven, Kerem Demirbay, Edmond Tapsoba who are all over the virus as well. Young talent Florian Wirtz could return after his encounter with  COVID-19, while Exequiel Palacios could come into midfield after recovering from a back injury.The Bender brothers, Sven and Lars, will retire at the end of the season. Lars needs an operation and will be out until the end of March, while Sven is struggling with an ankle injury.Paulinho is back in training after an ACL injury, while Santiago Arias, on loan from Atletico Madrid, is also out after suffering a fibula fracture while on international duty with Colombia last year.

After the shock home defeat last weekend, Bayer Leverkusen have taken only 12 points from 13 games, a disappointing run since topping the table briefly before Xmas playing some delightful football. This untimely slump leaves coach Peter Bosz's job hanging by a thread, but at least Leverkusen do not have to worry about Europa League inconvenience on Thursdays after their exit there as well.Hertha have garnered 21 points from 25 games this season, which is frankly shocking considering no Bundesliga club spent more on transfers in 2020 than the capital city club. Leverkusen need to win to stay in the hunt for a Champions League qualification spot, but have failed to score in their three games against Hertha. Neither of these two sides can be backed with any confidence so a draw could be a good shout.","Sun",-1.23440897719304,-0.433647758542406,-0.67543237803665,0.871558112008047,-1.01786132911734,0.292121259027812,-0.895430537895596,-0.728457924404154,-0.802673439425146,-0.594242642687625,-0.64675657894667,-0.575119786477406,-1.0172420472354,0.913954466037397,"HOME_WIN"

A genuine relegation six-pointer.Mainz have beaten RB Leipzig and Gladbach lately and have shown definite signs of improvement under new coach Bo Svensson, moving away from the automatic relegation spots (for now).However, Mainz have squandered 15 points from leading positions explaining why they are towards the foot of the table in the first place.Lowly Arminia Bielefeld shocked Bayer Leverkusen recently and took a deserved point off Bayern in their own backyard as well, but have since plummeted into the bottom two.Bielefeld are clearly not to be underestimated, bu Mainz are on an upward curve and should take the three points on home soil.","Sat",-0.667802451353949,-1.54642106760683,0.0341746757083625,-0.625496733727206,0.521046062752853,-0.937575341182793,0.425433433915194,-0.7436653617817,0.979988922342279,-0.890239177200284,1.22237404629659,-0.666939153371428,-1.07817517734103,-1.60629876279242,"DRAW"

Reported Liverpool target Ibrahima Konaté is likely to step into defence.January signing Dominik Szoboszlai has adductor problems and has still not played his first game for the club.Willi Orban may play with a cast on his fractured hand, but Angelino is struggling with a muscle injury. Swede Emil Forsberg could play as a false nine up front.German international Benjamin Henrichs has returned from a knee injury, but Konrad Laimer is still on his way back from his own knee injury.Bayern's team news states that Robert Lewandowski has been ruled out for four weeks in a massive blow for Bayern Munich. Lewandowski is currently on 35 league goals for the season, just five shy of Gerd Muller's Bundesliga record of 40 in a single campaign. Bayern will also be without Alphonso Davies, who serves the first of a two-game ban for his red card against Stuttgart before the break, and Jerome Boateng, who sits out for one match due to an accumulation of bookings. Tanguy Nianzou is back in training after muscle injury, Douglas Costa has a foot injury and is ruled, as is Corentin Tolisso with a muscle injury.

Four points behind Bayern, RB Leipzig have at least kept the title race interesting in Germany for seemingly the first time in eight years. 13 clean sheets from reliable goalkeeper Péter Gulácsi are a league best for Leipzig.Both sides have injury worries at the back so we should see a few goals even without the prolific Robert Lewandowski on display. Bayern's sixth comeback win of the season against Dortmund recently matched a club record and keeps the champions on course for the title. In 76 competitive games under coach Hansi Flick, Bayern have only failed to score once - in February 2020 against RB Leipzig. 78 goals after 26 Bundesliga games is a new club record as well.With Lewandowski absent, this represents a perfect chance for Leipzig to win, but Bayern normally find a way with the title up for grabs and Serge Gnabry is a good option to have up your sleeve in a more attacking role.","Sat",1.03201712616333,2.62647884138477,-0.533510967287647,0.599366321874364,2.61955614257585,1.52181785923842,1.85659787599298,2.31757648899772,1.87132010322599,1.47773309890102,1.59620017134524,1.90400311966123,1.66381567741224,2.63510301255532,"AWAY_WIN"

The Liverpool loanee performed well though after stepping in for his first Bundesliga game in well over four years.Christopher Lenz is nearing a return from a muscle injury, but striker Anthony Ujah has had yet another operation because of a long-term knee issue.

Union are the draw specialists with a league high of 12, and will be ecstatic with number 13 in the Bavarian capital.Seven points clear after their win in Leipzig, Bayern's ninth title in succession is a mere formality.In 77 competitive games under coach Hansi Flick, Bayern have only failed to score once - in February 2020 against RB Leipzig. 79 goals after 27 Bundesliga games is a new club record as well.With the pressure off at the top, and more than one eye on the Champions League return in Paris, Bayern may ease off here allowing Union to nick a point.","Sat",2.7318367036806,-0.433647758542406,-0.10774673504064,-0.897688523860888,1.50035076667025,-0.117777607709057,3.58657281608001,-0.571147484770778,2.4655408904818,-0.29824610817496,2.34385242144254,-0.391481052689356,2.69967888920792,0.483667329407916,"DRAW"

Gladbach are a strange side, relinquishing a league-high 21 points from winning positions, but have earned 16 points from losing positions this season, leading to a stack of draws (10) as a consequence.Despite taking seven points from 12, Hertha have mustered a paltry 25 points from 27 games this season, which is awful considering no Bundesliga club are one of the league's biggest spenders in the last year.Gladbach need to win to stay in the hunt for a European qualification spot, but neither of these two sides can be backed with any confidence so a draw could be a good shout here.","Sat",-0.384499188434403,0.122738895989807,-0.817353788785652,0.463270426807523,-0.458258641164546,0.0188553478698993,-0.606959141854722,-0.501845556310942,0.0886577414585668,-0.29824610817496,0.287808733674958,0.526712616250878,-0.834442656918515,0.29925855656671,"DRAW"

Wolfsburg have proved tough to beat all season, helped by 13 clean sheets from goalkeeper Koen Casteels.Stuttgart have shown better form on their travels than at home with six away wins, but injuries to the ultra-talented Silas Wamangituka and Nicolás González are serious blows.

A relegation six-pointer with seven points between the two sides.Koln shocked second placed Leipzig in midweek and can drag Augsburg into further trouble who are not quite out of the relegation mire just yet under Heiko Herrlich.Koln have not kept a clean sheet in 14 games - the longest such run in the whole league, and have also failed to score 11 times this season. Not a good mix all in all and certainly explains why the Billy Goats are still in the bottom two.Neither of these two sides can be backed with any confidence so a draw could be a good shout, which will be a reasonable result for FCA.","Fri",-1.51771224011259,-0.433647758542406,0.176096086457365,-1.44207210412825,-0.318357969176346,-1.62074011907757,-0.721428966671698,-0.549826519687358,-0.802673439425146,-0.890239177200284,-0.92712617273316,-0.483300419583379,-0.895375787024143,-1.54482917184535,"AWAY_WIN"

Tanguy Nianzou is back in training after muscle injury, Douglas Costa has a foot injury and is ruled out as is Corentin Tolisso with a muscle injury.

Coach Hansi Flick has dropped a bombshell, announcing that he wants out at the end of the season, but 10 points clear with four games remaining, Bayern's ninth title in succession will be sealed with a win this weekend. In 81 competitive games under Flick, Bayern have only failed to score once - in February 2020 against RB Leipzig. Mainz are one of the form sides of 2021, but have squandered 17 points from winning positions this season. They have also lost eight in a row against Bayern, who will likely have Robert Lewandowski back. It's party time for the away side.","Sat",0.182107337404689,0.957318877788127,-0.533510967287647,0.0549827416069996,0.940748078717452,1.11191899250155,0.292611095025876,2.848812764436,1.87132010322599,1.77372963341368,1.78311323386957,1.62854501897916,-0.956308917129771,2.8809813763436,"HOME_WIN"

After a shock defeat in Koln, RB Leipzig's title hopes are over, but at least the side from Eastern Germany kept the title race interesting into April. With some tough games to finish the season, they need to get back to winning ways here or they could get dragged in to the race to even finish in the top four. Stuttgart have shown better form on their travels than at home with six away wins, but injuries to the ultra-talented Silas Wamangituka and Nicolás González are serious blows.

Julian Nagelsmann starts his farewell tour with a rehearsal of the DFB Pokal Finale to be played next Thursday.This constitutes a massive fixture in the context of a top four finish for Borussia Dortmund, who have edged to within two points of Wolfsburg and just a point behind Eintracht Frankfurt with a better goal difference.RB Leipzig's title hopes are all but over but they are virtually assured of finishing in second to Bayern, a position Borussia Dortmund are only too familiar with during the past nine seasons.Péter Gulácsi has a league-best 15 clean sheets, while Borussia Dortmund have scored in 42 games in a row in all competitions but have lost 10 times and are currently on track to miss out on Champions League football for next season.With Sancho back Dortmund are a much more dangerous side and if Erling Haaland is fit, Dortmund can edge to victory to further close the gap to fourth spot. If Haaland is missing then it is a tough ask for BVB.","Sat",1.31532038908287,-0.1554544312763,1.02762455095138,1.00765400707489,2.05995345462305,0.292121259027812,1.33451636284382,-0.0460168549914466,1.57420970959809,-0.00224957366229594,2.06348282765605,0.251254515568806,1.48101628709536,1.83599833024343,"HOME_WIN"

They haven't disclosed who is out but it's just typical of Schalke's season, which they didn't think could get much worse.Hertha Berlin's team news states that Dodi Lukebakio, Marvin Plattenhardt and Eduard Löwen have all returned to training and may come into consideration.Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi broke his foot and definitely won't feature again this season.Maximilian Mittelstädt suffered a bad collision against Bielefeld and is doubtful with concussion.Sami Khedira is struggling with a calf problem, while Matheus Cunha has an ankle injury from the weekend goalless draw.Skipper Dedryck Boyata had not featured at all this year, but made his starting comeback last week.Rune Jarstein has tested positive for COVID-19. Alexander Schwolow will play in goal.Luca Netz is ruled out for the rest of the season after a fracturing his foot.Striker Jhon Cordoba will miss the final two games with an ankle injury picked up at the weekend. Krzysztof Piatek stands by up front

This is relegation-threatened Hertha's fourth game in just over a week following a COVID-19 enforced break. Coach Pal Dardai made eight changes to the starting line up last time out, nine in the game before that against Freiburg in an attempt to keep his troops fresh. However, a point per game on average from 31 games this season is dreadful for Hertha considering the capital city club's massive outlay on transfers in 2020.Schalke are relegated after a horror season which covered five different managers and much grumbling in Gelsenkirchen. They have secured just two wins in a miserable campaign, squandering a comfortable two-goal half-time lead in Hoffenheim in their last outing. In fact, Schalke have won only two Bundesliga games in their last 47, a sorry decline which started pre-COVID.Schalke enjoy a day's extra rest than the visitors but it's done them little good as they've now lost seven players to COVID.","Wed",-0.951105714273495,-0.1554544312763,-0.959275199534655,0.191078636673841,-1.99716603303474,0.0188553478698993,-1.11627410192717,0.0754478737221612,-1.09978383305305,-0.00224957366229594,-1.30095229778181,0.159435148674783,-3.63736664177741,-0.684254898586391,"AWAY_WIN"

All eyes will be on whether Lewandowski can smash the Bundesliga scoring record, but maybe Freiburg can snatch a draw here.","Sat",0.465410600324235,1.51370553232034,-0.67543237803665,0.463270426807523,0.521046062752853,0.975286036922592,-0.296843167353515,2.04452638840125,0.0886577414585668,0.885740029875692,0.38126526493712,0.893990083826973,0.140487424771536,3.18832933107894,"DRAW"

The Nigerian talent has already enjoyed more success than compatriot Tolu Arokodare who has failed to make any sort of impact up front.

Koln have not kept a clean sheet in 16 games - the longest such run in the whole league, and have also failed to score 11 times this season. Not a good mix and certainly explains why the Billy Goats are haunted by the prospect of relegation with just two games remaining.This is relegation-threatened Hertha's fifth game in 12 days following a COVID-19 enforced break, but the capital city side are unbeaten in seven games and moved five points ahead of Koln.  Coach Pal Dardai made eight changes to the starting line up last time out, after making nine and eight in the two games before that in an attempt to keep his troops fresh. Koln have quite a decent away record with five wins, having shocked second placed Leipzig and beaten Borussia Dortmund as well.The heavy workload, injuries and suspensions could catch up with Hertha here allowing Koln to grab a relegation lifeline.","Sat",0.182107337404689,0.122738895989807,0.885703140202378,-1.85035978932878,0.800847406729252,-0.937575341182793,0.225831812347215,-0.678524544567996,0.682878528714373,-0.29824610817496,1.03546098377226,-0.0242035851132617,-0.590710136496002,-1.66776835373949,"DRAW"

Fears that Eintracht Frankfurt could squander Champions League qualification look like coming to fruition. A seven point gap over Borussia Dortmund is no more as the Eagles have only one win in four games since news broke that Adi Hütter will take over at Borussia Monchengladbach next season. With Hütter in charge, Eintracht have only lost five games this term, seriously punching above their weight and garnering 15 more points than during the whole of last season.Schalke lost in midweek to Hertha and are already relegated after a horror season which covered five different managers and much grumbling in Gelsenkirchen. Schalke have won only two Bundesliga games in their last 48, a sorry decline which started pre-COVID.Eintracht should have too much for sorry Schalke as the Eagles hope for a slip-up from BVB in their last two games.","Sat",-0.951105714273495,0.122738895989807,-1.38503943178166,1.00765400707489,-2.13706670502294,-0.254410563288012,-1.16641751787949,0.711005560604449,-1.09978383305305,-0.00224957366229594,-1.5813218915683,-0.391481052689356,-3.69829977188304,0.913954466037397,"HOME_WIN"

Mainz are one of the form sides of 2021, enjoying their best ever second half of the season with 30 points, as evidenced by a recent win over the champions Bayern.Borussia Dortmund have scored in 45 games in a row in all competitions, but have lost 10 times, putting Champions League football for next season in jeopardy.With the brilliant Sancho and Haaland in tandem Dortmund are a much more dangerous side and can edge to victory against a Mainz side who are all but safe from relegation, perhaps not showing the recent levels of urgency in their play.","Sun",0.182107337404689,1.79189885958645,-0.67543237803665,0.463270426807523,0.521046062752853,1.52181785923842,0.918281187085424,1.57614946054464,1.27709931597018,2.365722702439,0.66163485872361,2.1794612203433,-0.895375787024143,1.52865037550808,"AWAY_WIN"

RB Leipzig flattered to deceive in the DFB Pokal Final on Thursday and will no doubt be a bit leggy after back-to-back games against Borussia Dortmund.Julian Nagelsmann continues his farewell tour and the alleged ""Wundertrainer"" has still never won any silverware in professional football, just like his current club RB Leipzig. Never mind Julian a few bits of silverware are surely guaranteed at next club Bayern Munich.This constitutes a massive fixture in the context of a top four finish for third-placed Wolfsburg who are two points ahead of Borussia Dortmund and three points ahead of Eintracht Frankfurt with a better goal difference.RB Leipzig's title hopes are over but at least are assured of Champions League football next season. Péter Gulácsi has a league-best 15 clean sheets, while Koen Casteels has 14 himself so goals might be in short supply.Wolfsburg have nine draws and that could be the solution here again with honours shared.","Sun",0.465410600324235,0.957318877788127,1.02762455095138,0.463270426807523,0.940748078717452,0.0188553478698993,-0.387177123788466,0.278522276888513,0.0886577414585668,-0.29824610817496,-0.272930453898018,0.251254515568806,1.7856819376235,1.52865037550808,"DRAW"

VfB, three-time Bundesliga champions, have a host of injuries, and are badly missing Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka Fundu, who combined for 27 goals last season. A draw could be a good shout here in the south west derby.","Sat",-0.951105714273495,-0.1554544312763,-0.533510967287647,0.463270426807523,0.381145390764653,-1.34747420791966,-0.739434463362928,0.0684223126887968,-1.39689422668096,-0.594242642687625,-1.11403923525748,-0.116022952007289,-0.164178225756605,0.176319374672572,"HOME_WIN"

Winless Arminia have drawn five out of eight this term, and much like last season, face a long, drawn out battle against relegation. Despite two away defeats, BVB went top (for a day) last weekend, and hopes remain high that the Black and Yellows can mount a title challenge for the first time in a decade.Dortmund were smashed 4-0 by Ajax in the Champions League in midweek and will look to bounce back here.","Sat",-1.51771224011259,1.51370553232034,-0.533510967287647,-0.625496733727206,-0.877960657129145,-0.664309430024881,-0.858649603190736,1.05040833120447,-1.39689422668096,1.47773309890102,-1.20749576651965,1.35308691829709,-0.407910746179117,0.483667329407916,"AWAY_WIN"

Frankfurt have only beaten leaders Bayern and bottom side Fuerth this season with both wins coming on their travels courtesy of late goals.

Marcel Sabitzer has a calf injury and will also miss the big one against Borussia Dortmund this week. Tanguy Nianzou suffered a shoulder injury in Kiev and is ruled out, as is Bouna Sarr with an adductor injury.

Left-back Lennart Czyborra had an appendix operation in midweek.

Bayern aim to bounce back from a shock Bavarian derby defeat to noisy neighbours Augsburg, their second league defeat of the season under Julian Nagelsmann.Bayern have scored in 59 straight league matches and notched 101 Bundesliga goals in total in 2021.

Key man Simon Zoller suffered an ACL injury and will not play again for the foreseeable future.

Bochum garnered another precious point against Dortmund after picking up five wins in seven games prior to the Ruhr Derby.Despite a perfectly acceptable defensive record, Arminia are awful in front of goal only scoring 10 goals in 15 games making them the league's lowest scorers.Bochum are yet to draw away from home this season, while Bielefeld are yet to win at home this season, so a draw could be a good shout here between the last two Bundesliga 2 champions.","Tue",-0.951105714273495,0.122738895989807,0.176096086457365,-0.761592628794048,-1.71736468905834,0.155488303448856,-0.731855676332884,0.311548131083584,-0.505563045797245,0.885740029875692,-1.02058270399532,0.710351350038924,-0.712576396707258,-0.438376534798116,"HOME_WIN"

Denis Zakaria, Keanan Bennetts, Mamadou Doucoure and Joe Scally could all return after COVID. The former is being linked with a January move to Manchester United. Ramy Bensebaini is away at the Africa Nations Cup with Algeria.Jonas Hofmann is nearing a return from a knee op.Leverkusen's team news states that Niklas Lomb and Paulinho both have COVID. Charles Aranguiz is nearing a return from a calf injury, but Daley Sinkgraven has suffered a muscle tear.Defenders Odilon Kossounou and Edmond Tapsoba are both away on Africa Cup of Nations duty as well.Austrian Julian Baumgartlinger nears a return from a knee injury and Mitchel Bakker is back from an ankle injury.

Gladbach halted an alarming slide down the table with a 2-1 win against an under-strength Bayern last time out. Bayer Leverkusen's last four games have seen 18 goals in total, so we can expect goals at both ends.Flattering to deceive as usual this season, Leverkusen can at least rely on prolific goalscorer Patrik Schick who has scored 17 goals this season. Leverkusen have won their last four against Gladbach but may have to settle for a draw here.","Sat",-0.384499188434403,1.79189885958645,-0.67543237803665,1.14374990214173,-0.038556625199947,1.2485519480805,1.32304754071343,-0.111858555577088,-0.802673439425146,-0.594242642687625,-0.0860173913736938,-0.9423972540535,-0.529777006390374,0.729545693196191,"AWAY_WIN"

The Match of the Day in the Bundesliga as the leaders Bayern take a nine points lead at the top to play fourth placed Hoffenheim.Bayern won the reverse fixture 4-0 and will be confident of stretching their Bundesliga record of scoring in 72 straight matches.But Hoffenheim are one of the few teams that have given as good as they got over the years against the top team in German football as Julian Nagelsmann returns to his former side, along with the likes of Niklas Süle and Serge Gnabry.Hoffenheim have won their last four games, coming from behind in two of those, showing just why they have garnered a league-best 21 points from losing positions this season.It is always unwise to tip against Bayern, especially with Neuer back in goal, but they are here for the taking by an in-form Hoffenheim side.","Sat",-0.101195925514857,0.957318877788127,0.601860318704372,1.00765400707489,0.241244718776453,1.52181785923842,0.709011193551908,1.73737991830471,1.57420970959809,0.885740029875692,2.06348282765605,0.710351350038924,0.749818725827818,3.00392055823774,"DRAW"

Greuther Fuerth have conceded 70 goals, the worst defensive record in the league, but were unbeaten in their last six at home, before losing 6-1 to in-form Leipzig, a game where Fuerth had the temerity to take the lead.Freiburg are chasing Champions League qualification and talented keeper Mark Flekken has kept the joint most clean sheets of eight, with only Bayern having conceded fewer goals (28). Freiburg should claim the points against relegation-bound Fuerth as they chase down that Champions League qualification spot, but the scoreline maybe closer than their table position would indicate.","Sat",-0.384499188434403,0.67912555052202,0.176096086457365,0.0549827416069996,-0.318357969176346,0.292121259027812,-0.928052337282096,0.421785519689308,-0.802673439425146,1.18173656438835,-1.30095229778181,1.26126755140307,-2.66243656008736,0.852484875090329,"DRAW"

Freiburg have dropped from second to fifth in 2023, including a 6-0 drubbing in Wolfsburg, but remain only three points behind leaders Bayern.Dutch keeper Mark Flekken has kept the most clean sheets in the Bundesliga with eight.Despite six defeats already this season, Dortmund have won all three matches in 2023, and are suddenly only three points behind Bayern in fourth place, above the visitors on goal difference.Dortmund have not played out a 0-0 draw in 109 games. Their last goalless affair was in October 2019.Freiburg have garnered just a single point in their last 14 trips to Dortmund, so a narrow home win with goals at both ends is the call.","Sat",0.748713863243781,0.400932223255914,1.16954596170038,-1.16988031399457,1.50035076667025,-0.254410563288012,1.26370218057125,0.239524298628826,0.682878528714373,-0.00224957366229594,1.50274364008308,0.343073882462833,0.506086205405305,0.237788965619641,"HOME_WIN"

Freefalling Hofffenheim have had all week to prepare, while the hosts travelled to Turin to face Juventus in the Europa League on Thursday.Without a win in 14 games, a recent change in head coach from Andre Breitenreiter to Pellegrino Matarazzo hasn't reaped any dividends for Hoffenheim who've lost six in a row.

Sebastian Andersson is on his way back from knee surgery.

After eight straight wins to start the year, second-placed Dortmund sloppily dropped points for the first time this year in the Ruhr derby. The title-chasers haven't featured in a 0-0 draw in 113 games, a run stretching back to October 2019. Koln have drawn the most games in the league failing to score in six of their last seven games, including the last four and boast the worst attack in 2023 with just three goals to their name. With Bayern playing on Sunday, Dortmund can go top with a win and should nick a narrow win in front of their passionate home fans.","Sat",1.03201712616333,-1.26822774034073,1.02762455095138,1.14374990214173,1.78015211064665,-0.254410563288012,2.44031882053543,-0.568290280252924,1.87132010322599,-0.890239177200284,1.40928710882091,-1.30967472162959,1.17635063656722,-0.376906943851047,"HOME_WIN"

The hosts enjoy all week to prepare, while Freiburg were knocked out of the Europa League by Juventus on Thursday.Improving Mainz have won four in a row at home and are pushing for Europa League qualification themselves.

A genuine relegation six-pointer. Mainz are two points behind a relegation-playoff spot, but a miserable 18 goals scored coupled with nine draws have prevented any upward trajectory.Gladbach picked up their first win in six games last weekend, but have dropped the most points after taking the lead this season, a massive 23 points in fact, losing the lead on nine seperate occasions.As expected Mainz lost to the league leaders last Friday, but prior to that grabbed only their second win of the season to give Bo Henriksen, their third boss of the season, a great start to his tenure.The reverse fixture ended in a 2-2 draw and another stalemate could be on the best option here again.","Sat",-0.951105714273495,-0.433647758542406,1.31146737244938,-0.217209048526683,0.381145390764653,-0.391043518866969,-0.949800610824886,0.021569149517566,-0.802673439425146,-0.594242642687625,-0.553300047684508,-0.207842318901311,-1.13910830744666,-0.253967761956909,"DRAW"
