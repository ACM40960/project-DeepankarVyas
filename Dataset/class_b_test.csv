After three losses in their first three games, Hoffenheim have finally found their form and managed to win their last two games, scoring six in the process. Manager Babbel's job seems to be safe for now.Augsburg are last in the table with only one point from five games so far. They have only scored two times and need to avoid defensive mistakes and work on attacking patterns now to regain confidence. Expect Hoffenheim to dominate the game at home. They should be clear favourites against a disappointing Augsburg team so far.","Sat",1.62607509940167,-0.0161133973827366,1.3248235522573,0.80847343082371,1.11795294387116,1.67319949271023,0.27744083029233,0.668561901089053,0.418331501646803,0.657007834344637,0.426880948609926

Fürth have only won once this season. They have not won a point or scored at home so far and need to improve in all areas if they are to have any chance.Hamburg have been in fine form lately, having won seven points from three games against Dortmund, Gladbach and Hannover.

Frankfurt have been the biggest surprise package in the early stages of the season. They lost their first game on matchday seven, two weeks ago, and need to regain confidence at home now to improve their impressive record.Hannover have done well so far, too. They managed a draw against Dortmund last time out and have used the international break to get some players fit again.Expect this to become an intense game.

After a heavy defeat at Bremen two matchdays ago, Gladbach recovered well with a narrow away win at Hannover last weekend. Injuries and players in poor form keep costing them consistency, especially in attacking areas.Freiburg lost against Dortmund last weekend, after two convincing wins before. The team should not have lost too much confidence and will try to defend solidly and take one of their few chances against Gladbach.Expect this to be a close game.

Gladbach have managed to win two in a row to snap a run of six straight defeats, nose-diving since news broke that highly-coveted coach Marco Rose will not be at the helm next term. Gladbach are a strange side, relinquishing a league-high 21 points from winning positions, but have earned 16 points from losing positions this season, leading to a stack of draws (10) as a consequence.Despite taking seven points from 12, Hertha have mustered a paltry 25 points from 27 games this season, which is awful considering no Bundesliga club are one of the league's biggest spenders in the last year.Gladbach need to win to stay in the hunt for a European qualification spot, but neither of these two sides can be backed with any confidence so a draw could be a good shout here.","Sat",-0.356556459564471,-0.904719870695425,-0.332863575191775,-0.0501053499050004,0.275168968091921,-0.175406279089955,-0.800049500489414,-0.145248963027527,-0.584957786646566,-1.48783362016253,-0.605629085760058
