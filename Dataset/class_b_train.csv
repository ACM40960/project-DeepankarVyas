Düsseldorf have had a great start to the season with three draws and two wins from five matches. They are unbeaten and have not conceded a goal so far.Schalke have enjoyed a solid start as well and they are one point ahead of Düsseldorf in the table. They have a lot of quality players, but it remains to be seen if some of them can finally improve their form.Expect this to be a close game from the outset.

The players need to find their focus again and can't solely rely on their attacking quality.Gladbach have had a difficult start to the season as well. There is a lot of work to do for manager Favre and his team. After they had to reshape the squad in the summer, there is no clear system and balance yet.Expect this to be a competitive game with Dortmund being slight favourites at home.

Hamburg were in good form against Gladbach and after a win against Dortmund the week before, the team has regained a lot of confidence and is on their way up.Hannover reacted well to their loss at Hoffenheim last weekend, beating Nürnberg 4-1 in midweek. With the return of Szabolcs Huszti, they regained a lot of quality and have improved massively on the attack.Expect this to be an intense game.

Leverkusen recovered well from their heavy loss at Dortmund three match days ago, and are back on track after four points from their last two matches. Manager Hyypiä still has to find the right balance though, as the team does not seem to be fulfilling their full potential yet. Creativity in midfield is still a problem.Fürth have had a difficult start to their first Bundesliga season with four points from five matches so far.

Nürnberg made a good start to the campaign, but after two defeats in their last two games, they need to regain focus and confidence. They can't allow their opponents that many chances and need to be more compact in midfield.Stuttgart are in very poor form as well and have not won a game so far. They need to avoid simple defensive mistakes and have to take their chances themselves.

Manager Heynckes might give Pizarro the chance to play against his former club.

Bremen have started quite well so far and their attack has a lot of potential. They have still problems at the back though and need to think about changes in midfield against a strong attacking team like Bayern.Bayern have made a perfect start to the season and many players have proven that they can fill in, if Heynckes rests one of his starters.

After being promoted to the Bundesliga this summer, Frankfurt have won 13 points from five matches so far and are second in the table, only behind Bayern. The team has a very good balance and the players have adapted to the stronger league quickly. It remains to be seen if they can continue their form for another few weeks, but they make very few mistakes and have been extremely focused so far.Freiburg have had a mixed start to another season in which they will most likely end up in the relegation battle again.

Düsseldorf are still eight points above the relegation play-off spot, but they need to improve after two straight losses.

Hoffenheim are in poor form; nine games without a win in the Bundesliga. The January signings have to adapt quickly to help their new team out of the relegation zone.Freiburg, on the other hand are in very good form and are five games without a loss.

Mainz are in impressive form and are fifth in the table.

After four games without defeat, Hamburg lost 3-1 at Mainz last weekend and struggled with their high pressing in Lewis Holtby's absence. They are back in the relegation zone and desperately need a positive result against a struggling Schalke side here.Schalke have lots of injury problems at the back and up front and have therefore begun to struggle with their balance in recent games. They have only won one away game in the Bundesliga this season and hope for the winter break to arrive to recover from an intense first half of the campaign.Expect this to be an intense and hard-fought game from the outset.","Tue",0.436496164021987,-0.312315555153633,0.642246499778271,0.271963731310883,0.275168968091921,0.748896606810137,-0.843149113720684,-0.633535481497475,-0.384299928987892,-1.0588653292611,-0.605629085760058

Gladbach have only won one of their last 10 Bundesliga matches and are under huge pressure to end the year 2016 with a positive result. Manager André Schubert could be replaced in the winter break and he will be desperate his players can change the team's fortunes around and convince the board to keep him as manager. Wolfsburg have only won two of their last 14 league games as well and manager new Valerien Ismael is already under pressure, after sporting director Klaus Allofs was sacked last week.

Bayern are top of the table on goal difference only and want to make a statement against their main domestic rivals so far. They struggled to break down Darmstadt at the weekend though and could therefore switch back to a 4-2-3-1 formation here to allow an extra attacking player to come in on the flanks.Leipzig can make a huge statement here and should play aggressive and press high from the outset.

Hoffenheim are the only team in the Bundesliga yet to lose so far, but nine draws from 15 matches also keep them well away from the top of the table. The team hopes to get a win against an improved, but suspect, Werder defence to conclude their impressive year under manager Julian Nagelsmann.Werder are four games without a loss and have left the relegation zone for now.

They have only won a single match under manager Bruno Labbadia so far, who hopes to at least retain the gap to his former club here.Hamburg won an important home match against relegation rivals Freiburg last weekend and will hope to pick up another victory in a second straight six-pointer to retain a small chance of avoiding the drop for the first time in the club's history. They have not won on the road since the second match day, but will give everything to take advantage of Wolfsburg's very poor home form to shorten the gap to their northern rivals to two points.Expect this to be a hard-fought game from the outset, with Hamburg better used to the pressure and possibly having the mental edge to get a desperately needed win.","Sat",-0.7530827713577,-0.805985818105126,-1.30797365016182,-0.477722128359762,-0.356919013742506,-0.637557722039999,0.622237736142488,0.831324073912369,1.2209629322815,0.44252368889392,0.633382955483923

Hertha have only found the net six times this year, while Augsburg kept their first clean sheet in nine games in the vital win at Mainz.After that hideous run, Hertha are just a point off the relegation spot and need to start picking up points and new (and old) coach Pal Dardai's side can nick the win here.","Sat",-0.356556459564471,0.773759023339653,1.03229052976629,-0.65012848024209,-0.567615007687316,-0.967665895575749,-0.153555302020368,0.505799728265737,0.418331501646803,0.228039543443202,0.426880948609926

Spurning a 2-0 half time lead in Leipzig last weekend is typical for Gladbach, who have relinquished a league-high 21 points from winning positions already this season.Indeed, Gladbach winless in five games, have slumped since news broke that highly-coveted coach Marco Rose will not be at the helm next term. Bayer Leverkusen have taken only 9 points from 11 games, since topping the table briefly in December. The untimely slump leaves coach Peter Bosz's job hanging by a thread. Without a clean sheet in 11 attempts, Leverkusen at least do not have to worry about Europa League inconvenience on Thursdays any more.Gladbach exited the German Cup on Tuesday, while the visitors, unusually, have a full week to prepare.Both sides need to win to stay in the hunt for a Champions League qualification spot, so a draw is a good shout here.","Sat",-0.7530827713577,0.378822812978458,-1.21046264266482,0.300550173360991,-0.567615007687316,-0.505514452625702,-0.455252594639256,-0.308011135850843,0.217673643988129,0.44252368889392,0.0138769348619326
