### Motivation

The objective of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting the outcomes of football matches. This model aims to challenge existing betting models by leveraging a unique combination of engineered features, derived from domain-specific knowledge, and sentiment analysis of pre-match reports. By integrating and enhancing previous approachesâ€”some of which focus solely on statistical features while others emphasize text analyticsâ€”this project seeks to determine whether a synergistic combination of these methodologies can yield superior predictive results.

### Setting Up

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas.git   
   ```
2. After cloning the repository, it will create a dedicated project folder in your local working directory. Entire code of the project is written in **R** language and contains only **.R/.qmd** files. These files can be easily run in RStudio.
2. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing and running R scripts, visualizing data, and generating reports. Rstudio can be installed using this [link](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).
3. Install the required packages :
   ```
   # Vector of required packages
    packages <- c("knitr","rvest","dplyr","stringr","lubridate","tidyr","furrr", "ggplot2", 
                  "data.table","readr", "purrr","rstudioapi","zoo","tidyverse","tidytext","syuzhet",
                  "sentimentr","lexicon","textdata","caret","wordcloud","RColorBrewer","plotly","GGally","gridExtra",
                  "nortest","ggpubr","reshape2","car","Boruta","randomForest","doParallel","grid","e1071","keras","tfruns",
                  "pROC","MASS","ROCR","tensorflow","caret","kableExtra","multiROC","BBmisc") 

    # Function to check if a package is installed, and install it if not
    install_if_missing <- function(packages) {
      for (pkg in packages) {
        if (!requireNamespace(pkg, quietly = TRUE)) {
          install.packages(pkg)
        }
      }
    }

    # Install any missing packages
    install_if_missing(packages)
   ```

### Directory Structure

The entire code base is divided into directories, with each directoriy's content pertaining to a specific task of the project. Eah directory has these 2 files, along with its specific contents :-

1. *.R file - **R** script containg the code carrying out a specific task of the project
2. *.qmd file - **qmd** file containg the code carrying out a specific task of the project.

The code in both the files is exactly the same, with .R files updated with the latest comments. However, any of the files can be run in the RStudio to fetch the desired results.
