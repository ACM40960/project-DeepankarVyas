### Motivation

The objective of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting the outcomes of football matches. This model aims to challenge existing betting models by leveraging a unique combination of engineered features, derived from domain-specific knowledge, and sentiment analysis of pre-match reports. By integrating and enhancing previous approachesâ€”some of which focus solely on statistical features while others emphasize text analyticsâ€”this project seeks to determine whether a synergistic combination of these methodologies can yield superior predictive results.

### Setting Up

To set up the project in your local machine :- 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas.git   
   ```
2. After cloning the repository, it will create a dedicated project folder in your local working directory. Entire code of the project is written in **R** language and contains only **.R/.qmd** files. These files can be easily run in RStudio.
2. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing and running R scripts, visualizing data, and generating reports. Rstudio can be installed using this [link](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).
3. The project requires the following packages to be installed in your machine. The following piece of code has also been included as the first line in the first .R file. To install the required packages :
   ```
   # Vector of required packages
    packages <- c("knitr","rvest","dplyr","stringr","lubridate","tidyr","furrr",
                  "ggplot2", "data.table","readr", "purrr","rstudioapi","zoo",
                  "tidyverse","tidytext","syuzhet","sentimentr","lexicon",
                  "textdata","caret","wordcloud","RColorBrewer","plotly",
                  "GGally","gridExtra","nortest","ggpubr","reshape2","car",
                  "Boruta","randomForest","doParallel","grid","e1071","keras",
                  "tfruns","pROC","MASS","ROCR","tensorflow","caret","kableExtra",
                  "multiROC","BBmisc") 

    # Function to check if a package is installed, and install it if not
    install_if_missing <- function(packages) {
      for (pkg in packages) {
        if (!requireNamespace(pkg, quietly = TRUE)) {
          install.packages(pkg)
        }
      }
    }

    # Install any missing packages
    install_if_missing(packages)
   ```
---

### Directory Structure

The entire code base is divided into directories, with each directory's content pertaining to a specific task of the project. Most of the directories has these 2 files while some have only .R file, along with its specific contents :-

1. *.R file - **R** script containg the code carrying out a specific task of the project
2. *.qmd file - **qmd** file containg the code carrying out a specific task of the project.

The code in both the files is exactly the same, although .R files have been updated with the latest comments. However, any of the files can be run in the RStudio to fetch the desired results.

### Methodology
#### Dataset Preparation

The dataset was prepared using Web - Scraping . Base Features and Betting Odds were taken from [Football-Data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/germanym.php) [6] , Team Ratings were taken from [FIFA Index](https://www.fifaindex.com/teams/) [5]  and Pre - Match Reports were scraped from  - [WhoScored.com](https://www.whoscored.com/Regions/81/Tournaments/3/Germany-Bundesliga) [8] . Everything was collated to prepare a $${\color{green}Master \space \color{green}Dataset}$$.

The code to prepare the dataset using Web Scraping can be found here - [Dataset Preparation](https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/tree/main/dataset-preparation). This directory contains the .R file, and  can be run to Web Scrap the contents. First, the files for the past 10 Bundesliga seasons is downloaded from **Football-Data.co.uk**. Then, we web scrapped team's ratings from **FIFA Index** website starting from FIFA 12 till FIFA 24. These are the ratings given by FIFA video game to teams and players and are generated periodically, taking into account current form of teams and players, and thus are a good measure of the current state of the team. We focused on the team ratings and web scrapped following components of team ratings-
 1.  Attack Rating
 2.  Defense Rating
 3.  Midfield Rating
 4.  Overall Rating

This was accomplished using `rvest` package, which allows the functionality to download and manipulate xml contents. The ratings were then aggregrated by month so that each team has a defense, attack, midfield and overall rating for each month. Also, a custom team name mapping had to be defined as both the datasets scraped (Base features and betting odds; and the ratings dataset) had same team names worded differently. This was done to ensure uniformity. A sample is provided below :-
```
team_name_mapping <- list(
  "Bayern Munich" = c("Bayern MÃ¼nchen", "FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen", "FC Bayern Munich"),
  "Dortmund" = c("Borussia Dortmund"),
  "RB Leipzig" = c("RB Leipzig"),
  "Leverkusen" = c("Bayer 04 Leverkusen", "Leverkusen"),
)

```

If for some month we had missing values, the ratings for that month were imputed using the rating values of the nearby month, so as to ensure there is not much variation in the team's form. 

Next , Web - Scraping was done to extract pre- match reports from **WhoScored.com**. This will give us experts' opinion and will help us understand whether including experts' opinion help complement predictions generated through statistical features alone. The reports scraped contained both Team News and Experts' Pre-Match Predictions. Again , the team names had to be standardized to maintain uniformity. 

We finally merged the contents together and came up with $${\color{green}Master \space \color{green}Dataset}$$. Some issues encountered during this process :-
- Team names - Custom mapping had to be done to maintain uniformity in teams' naming.
- Run time - The enire web scraping process took more than $${\color{red}2 \space \color{red}days}$$ to complete on a machine with standard specifications. It is highly recommended to either run the process using parallel computation or run the process on a machine with higher computing power. However, datasets have already been created and could be used directly for running the forthcoming sections. The dataset prepared after web scraping , feature engineering ( discussed in length below) and sentiment analysis ( discussed in length below) is $${\color{green}Master \space \color{green}Dataset}$$, details of which could be found [here](https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/tree/main/Dataset).

**UPDATE** :- The websites have blocked web scraping. Therefore, if the user opts to go for the long web-scraping process while running the script, $${\color{green}Master \space \color{green}Dataset \space \color{green}Before \space \color{green}Preprocessing}$$ is used to bypass the Web-Scraping process so that the code doesn't break and user can proceed to the next step - FEATURE ENGINEERING.

#### Feature Engineering

We have a baseline dataset available , containing information like Goals scored and conceded, Corners, Xg, Shots on Target and Result. However, previous works in this field and our own domain knowledge suggest that the outcome of any sport match is highly unpredictable and various physical, psychological and geographical factors affect the outcome of any match. Therefore, we will engineer most of our features in order to capture as much information as we could to predict the result.

Base Features ,namely - FTHG (Full time Home Team Goals), FTAG (Full time Away Team Goals), HST (Home Team Shots on Target) , AST (Away Team Shots on Target), HC (Home Team Corners) and AC (Away team Corners) are used to engineer the features. Feature engineering was done maily beacuse :-
- To predict a football match, we need to have features available before hand. Therefore, features were engineered so that they depend only on a team's previous matches' statistics.
- Based on Domain knowledge, it was clear that one of the main factors affecting a football match's result is the teams' form. Hence, features were engineered to incorporate this variable.

Wherever applicable, features were engineered so that they depend only on a team's past 5 matches. The number 5 is static and is one of the areas of further research, to make this number dynamic and select it using cross-validation. The process of feature engineering is repeated afresh for each season, so that the previous season has no bearing on the current season. Since, we are finding features based on a team's performance in the previous 5 matches, no values were assigned to features of a team for the first 5 matches for each season. The first 5 matches of each team were thus removed from analysis. Since Home and Away match is a simple but an extremely important criterion, all these features were computed for both the home and away team for every match. A full list of features engineered along with the equations used, and additional details related to this section,  can be found in the README file here - [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/tree/main/feature-engineering) [1,3].

#### Sentiment Analysis and Data Cleanup

All the work in the field of Sports Analytics/ Predictions have been done either exclusively using statistical features or using exclusively text analytics. One of the motivations of this project is to use a combination of these features and find out whether this results in improved performance [2]. For this purpose, experts' pre - match analysis was used from **WhoScored.com** and sentiment analysis of each match's pre - match report was done to generate a score for both Home and Away team. Due to resource limitation, full fledged Sentiment Analysis using LLMs could not be achieved. However, R provides a pretty handy package `sentimentr`. The `sentimentr` package bolsters sentiment analysis with a lexicon of words that tend to slide sentiment a bit in one direction or the other. These words are known as valence shifters. It takes into account negations or hyperboles that are generally used in everyday speech. 

<div style="background-color: white; display: inline-block; padding: 10px;">
    <img width="734" alt="Wordcloud" src="https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/blob/main/eda-splitting/eda_images/Wordcloud.png">
   <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1: Wordlcoud generated through Sentiment Analysis.</em></p> 
</div>

However, this process was riddled with issues. Sentiment Analysis of a pre-match report is quite different from the Sentiment Analysis of, say, a novel or even a tweet related to the match . Discussed below are the issues and the proposed solutions for the same :-

1. Two subjects, instead of the usual one - One of the main issues encountered during sentiment analysis of a pre-match report is that the report pertains to two teams, not just one team. Therefore, the sentiments could range from extremely positive, to extremely negative , and could be related to different teams. Therefore, it was quite necessary to associate each sentence to one of the teams, for which it was used, and then perform sentiment analysis for each team, using each team's sentences.
2. Varied names for a team - While writing pre - match reports, full name of the team is rarley used. Author often resorts to using short names or even nicknames of the teams. Therefore, it was necessary to have a standardize naming of the teams, or map each name used to a standard name in order to achieve the point discussed above.
3. Custom Lexicon - Lexicon used by the package is of the English vocabulary. Hoever, sports vocabulary could turn out to be quite different from the one used in a general sense. For eg:- "Attack" in general sense conveys negative emotion. But in footballing terms, it could convey positive emotions , suggesting the attacking mindset of the teams. Therefore, in addition to the lexicon used, custom lexicon was designed which was more focused on the terminology used in football and the associated sentiment score.

The code for the Sentiment Analysis could be found here - [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/tree/main/data-cleanup-nlp). This directory contains both the .R and .qmd files, and  either can be run to generate the sentiment scores . Major functionalities implemented in this file , covering the points above :-

Team mapping to standardize team names -

# Corrected team name mapping
team_name_mapping <- list(
  "Bayern Munich" = c("Bayern Munich", "Bayern MÃ¼nchen", "FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen",
                      "FC Bayern Munich", "Bayern"),
  "Dortmund" = c("Dortmund", "Borussia Dortmund"),
  "RB Leipzig" = c("RB Leipzig", "Leipzig", "RBL"),
  "Leverkusen" = c("Leverkusen", "Bayer 04 Leverkusen", "Bayer"),
  "Ein Frankfurt" = c("Ein Frankfurt", "Eintracht Frankfurt", "Frankfurt", "Eintracht"),
  "Hoffenheim" = c("Hoffenheim", "TSG 1899 Hoffenheim", "TSG Hoffenheim",
                  "1899 Hoffenheim"),
  "Wolfsburg" = c("Wolfsburg", "VfL Wolfsburg"),
  "Freiburg" = c("Freiburg", "SC Freiburg", "Sport-Club Freiburg"),
)

# Function to expand team names
expand_team_names <- function(mapping) {
  expanded <- tolower(unlist(mapping, use.names = FALSE))
  team_keys <- tolower(rep(names(mapping), lengths(mapping)))
  expanded_mapping <- setNames(team_keys, expanded)
  return(expanded_mapping)
}

# Expanding the team names from the mapping
expanded_mapping <- expand_team_names(team_name_mapping)

# Function to check if a sentence contains any team name from the mapping
contains_team_name <- function(sentence, team_names) {
  pattern <- paste0("\\b(", paste(unique(unname(team_names)), collapse = "|"), ")\\b")
  return(grepl(pattern, sentence))
}


# Function to associate sentences with teams
associate_sentences_with_teams <- function(text, home_team, away_team,
                                            expanded_mapping) {
  text_lower <- tolower(text)
  home_team <- tolower(home_team)
  away_team <- tolower(away_team)
  sentences <- unlist(strsplit(text_lower, split = "\\."))
  
  home_team_names <- names(expanded_mapping[expanded_mapping == home_team])
  away_team_names <- names(expanded_mapping[expanded_mapping == away_team])
  
  associated_sentences <- tibble(sentence = sentences, team = NA_character_)
  current_team <- home_team
  
  for (i in seq_along(sentences)) {
    sentence <- sentences[i]
    if (current_team == home_team && contains_team_name(sentence, away_team_names)) {
      current_team <- away_team
    } else if (current_team == away_team && contains_team_name(sentence,
                home_team_names)) {
      current_team <- home_team
    }
    associated_sentences$team[i] <- current_team
  }
  
  return(associated_sentences)
}

```

This is a sample list used to standardize team names . The pre - match reposrt is checked to see if it contains any of the two team names between whom match is going to be played from the above names. If it does, that particular sentence gets associated with that team. All other team names in the report, if they occur, are ignored. Once the sentence-team mapping is acheived, `sentiment_by()` function of `sentimentr` package is used to calculate the sentiment scores, for both the teams.

```
# Function to calculate sentence-level sentiment scores
calculate_sentence_sentiment <- function(sentences_with_teams) {
  sentiment_scores <- sentiment_by(sentences_with_teams$sentence,
                      by = list(sentences_with_teams$team)) %>%
    select(team = "sentences_with_teams$team", ave_sentiment)
  
  return(sentiment_scores)
}

```

Apart from this, data cleanup is also done to keep only the columns that will be used for further analysis and also the rows which contain NA values among the selected columns are removed.

#### EDA and Feature Selection

Once features have been engineered and sentiment analysis done, next step is Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Selection. Some of the interesting findings of Exploratory Data Analysis is as follows :-

1. Almost none of our features, whether Base features or Engineered features, follow normal distribution.

<div style="background-color: white; display: inline-block; padding: 10px;">
    <img width="734" alt="Home and Away Features" src="https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/blob/main/eda-splitting/eda_images/a%20(2).png">
   <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2: Normality violation of Engineered Features.</em></p> 
</div>

To overcome this, we calculated the difference between Home and Away features , called **Differential Features**, which were comparatively closer to normal distribution

<div style="background-color: white; display: inline-block; padding: 10px;">
    <img width="734" alt="Differential Features" src="https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/blob/main/eda-splitting/eda_images/b%20(2).png">
   <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 3: Approximately Normal distribution of Differential Features.</em></p> 
</div>

2. In addition to this, feature selection was done using `Boruta` package of R and through correlation matrix. Feature selection helps reduce complexity of the model by feeding only the relevant features and removing
   correlated and redundant features, thereby making model training faster.
   
- The Boruta algorithm is a wrapper built around the random forest classification algorithm. It tries to capture the important features in a dataset with respect to an outcome variable. It compares the importance of original features with that of shadow features, which are created by randomly shuffling the original features. During the process, Boruta duplicates all the features and shuffles them to create these shadow features, then fits a random forest model. It compares the importance scores of the actual features against these shadow features to determine their relevance. If a feature consistently outperforms the shadow features across multiple iterations, it is considered important and retained; otherwise, it is deemed unimportant and rejected. It can work on both numerical or categorical variables, or even a mixture of both.
- Correlation matrix determines how 2 variables are related linearly. If there is a high correlation between 2 variables, that means one of them can be considered redundant as the presence of one explains the effect of the other.

The figure below shows the output of `Boruta` algorithm and heatmap of `Correlation Matrix` :-

<div style="background-color: white; display: inline-block; padding: 10px;">
    <img width="734" alt="Feature Selection" src="https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/blob/main/eda-splitting/eda_images/image%20(2).png">
   <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 4: Borutal Importance plot and Correlation Matrix.</em></p> 
</div>


As shown in Figure 4 depicting the Correlation Matrix and Boruta Feature Selection, it became clear that the variables are highly correlated to their differential features and features such as - Day_Of_Week, Season are not important. These features were removed and based on the analysis done above , it was decided to divide our dataset into 4 different datasets :-

- Class A :- Home and Away features of the teams
- Class A NLP :- Home and Away features of the teams with Sentiment Scores
- Class B :- Differential features of the teams
- Class B NLP :- Differential features of the teams with Sentiment Scores

The code to perform **EDA and Feature Selection** can be found here - [EDA and Feature Selection](https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/tree/main/eda-splitting). This directory contains both the .R and .qmd files, and  either can be run to generate the desired analysis. The file reads from $${\color{green}Master \space \color{green}Dataset}$$ and creates separate train and test datasets for all the 4 datasets discussed above (80%- training and 20%- testing). 

A detailed description of all the datasets used can be found here - [Datasets](https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/tree/main/Dataset).

**NOTE** :- The BORUTA selection procedure could take more than $${\color{red}1 \space \color{red}day}$$ to complete on a machine with standard specifications

#### Model Training and Tuning

Once we have the datatset ready and EDA done, we are ready to train and tune our models. The 4 dataset have already been divided into train and test sets, and train set will be used for training and validation purpose. For each dataset , 5 models will be trained :-

- Logistic Regression
- SVM with Polynomial kernel
- SVM with RBF Kernel
- Random Forest
- Nueral Networks

Further details about the hyperparameters tuned for each model and the metric used for selecting the optimal hyperparameters can be found here [Model Training and Tuning](https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/tree/main/training-tuning_testing) (check out the README file of this section for more details).

#### Model Evaluation and Generalized Predictive Performance 
Once the models have been trained and stored along with their performance metrics in `.rds` files, we will use these results to determine the best performing model. Since **Draw** was the hardest , the model which predicted **Draw** was given slightly more importance . Along with Mean F1 and F1 of Draw class (which was the hardest class to predict), we used RPS too to finalize the model which performed the best. 


<div style="background-color: white; display: inline-block; padding: 10px;">
    <img width="734" alt="Model Comparison" src="https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/blob/main/Model_Selection_Evaluation/eval_images/Plot_mean_f1_draw_page-0001%20(1)%20(2).jpg">
   <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 5: Model Comparison using F1 Score and RPS.</em></p> 
</div>

The best model selection, however,  was done based on a huerestic involving **Mean F1 Score and RPS **. The algorithm for the heurestic is as follows :-

```
1. Arrange the dataset based on F1 Score of the Draw class of the models.
2. Decide a range of threshold values
3. Subtract threshold values from the highest F1_Score_Draw among the models .
4. Optimal threshold value is the max value which accounts for between 2 to 5 models,
   not going below 0.05.
5. Subtract optimal threshold value from the highest F1_Score_Draw and call it
   Threshold_F1_Draw.
5. Filter the models having F1_Score_Draw > Threshold_F1_Draw.
6. Rank the filtered datasets based on RPS value.
```

<div style="background-color: white; display: inline-block; padding: 10px;">
    <img width="500" alt="Model within Thresholds" src="https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/blob/main/Model_Selection_Evaluation/eval_images/Screenshot%202024-08-17%20at%2012.39.57.png">
   <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 6: Threshold values to determine optimal model selection.</em></p> 
</div>

Based on this, for our project, the best performing model was `Random Forest` trained on the dataset `Class B NLP` (differential features with sentiment scores).

<div style="background-color: white; display: inline-block; padding: 10px;">
    <img width="734" alt="Final Ranking Dataset" src="https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/blob/main/Model_Selection_Evaluation/eval_images/final_ranking_dataset_page-0001.jpg">
   <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 7: Final Ranking Dataset.</em></p> 
</div>

The selected model (Random Forest) was used to predict the unseen data (the test set of Class B NLP) , and gave the following results, with an **RPS of 0.2155** and an overall **Balanced Accuracy of around 57%**.

#### Comparison Against Benchmark Setting

We tested the performance of our model against the benchmark setting - **BET365 Odds**. Let's consider the set of odds provided by bookmakers for three possible outcomes of a game: away win, draw, and home win. The implied probabilities for these odds can be calculated by taking the inverse of each odd. However, these implied probabilities usually add up to more than one because bookmakers set odds in a way that favors them, leading to unfair odds. To adjust for this and get more accurate probabilities, we normalize the implied probabilities by dividing each by the sum of all implied probabilities (called the "booksum") [9]. 

<p align="center">
$\text{Let } \mathbf{O} = \{o_1; o_2; o_3\} \text{ be the bookmakers' odds for away win, draw and home win, respectively.}$<br><br>
$$\text{Then, the set of implied probabilities } (\pi = \{\pi_1; \pi_2; \pi_3\}) \text{ for the odds are computed by simply taking their inverse:}$$<br><br>

$$
\pi_i = \frac{1}{o_i} \quad \forall i = 1, 2, 3,
$$

$$\text{and we compute the normalized probabilities by dividing the inverse odds by the booksum } (\Pi), \text{ such that:}$$<br><br>

$$
p_i = \frac{o_i}{\Pi},
$$

$$\text{where}$$

$$
\Pi = \sum_{i=1}^{3} \pi_i.
$$

</p>

Even though our model did not beat the benchmark setting, it performed remarkably well and fared slightly better than the model used by the research paper which was used as this project's baseline. Also, the set of features having sentiment scores performed the best, indicating that a better sentiment analysis using LLMs could given even better results.

The code for the Model Evaluation, Generalized Predictive Performance and Comparison Against Benchmark Setting could be found here - [Model Selection and Evaluation](https://github.com/ACM40960/project-DeepankarVyas/tree/main/Model_Selection_Evaluation). This directory contains the .R file, and can be run to generate the desired analysis.

### Further Research

- To tune the number of matches to be considered for calculating the engineered features (k), instead of the static value 5.
- Find a better method to assign the value to the engineered features of the first k matches, instead of removing them
- Use better techniques for sentiment analysis.
- Integrating the model with a GUI which will enhance the ease of use.
